Overflowing dustbins with garbage scattered around them is a common sight in our country. If we search for dustbins in India on Google, more than half of the images of public bins show such a scene. This problem exists as the dustbins overflowing with trash are almost never emptied out at the correct time. People also tend to throw garbage into dustbins and then not pick it up if it falls out, thus creating scattered garbage around the dustbin. Seeing scattered trash people have a tendency to throw the trash on the ground, instead of inside the bin thinking “What difference does some more trash make?”.Our project aims to resolve this problem by making a smart dustbin with a piston in it, which ensures that garbage never spills out and alerts the authorities to empty the bin on time. Our smart dustbin will also have arms to pick up the trash around it automatically and put it inside itself to put an end to the scattered trash around it.With this project we hope to make our contribution to help clean our country.
